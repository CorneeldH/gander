gander is a higher-performance and lower-friction chat experience for data scientists in RStudio and Positron. The package brings [ellmer](https://ellmer.tidyverse.org) chats into your project sessions, automatically incorporating relevant context and streaming their responses directly into your documents.

**Why not just chat?** In many ways, working with gander is just like using a chat interface online or via [shinychat](https://github.com/jcheng5/shinychat). The gander assistant will  automatically find the context it needs, though: 

* Variables, allowing the assistant to locate the column names and types in data frames you're working with, images linked to in your documents, and function definitions
* File contents from elsewhere in the project you're working on (e.g. the lines in your source file) 

## Installation

You can install gander like so:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/gander")
```

Then, ensure that you have an [`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`](https://console.anthropic.com/) environment variable set, and you're ready to go. If you'd like to use an LLM other than Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet—like OpenAI's GPT-4o or a local ollama model—and then set the `.gander_fn` and `.gander_args` options in your `.Rprofile`, like `options(.gander_fn = "chat_openai")` to use OpenAI's GPT-4o or `options(.gander_fn = "chat_openai", .gander_args = list(model = "gpt-4o-mini"))` to use their GPT-4o-mini model.

The gander assistant is interfaced with the via the gander addin. For easiest access, we recommend registering the gander addin to a keyboard shortcut.

**In RStudio**, navigate to `Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts > Search "gander"`—we suggest `Ctrl+Alt+G` (or `Ctrl+Cmd+G` on macOS).

**In Positron**, you'll need to open the command palette, run "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)", and paste the following into your `keybindings.json`:

```json
    {
        "key": "Ctrl+Cmd+G",
        "command": "workbench.action.executeCode.console",
        "when": "editorTextFocus",
        "args": {
            "langId": "r",
            "code": "gander::gander_addin()",
            "focus": true
        }
    }
```

The analogous keybinding on non-macOS is `Ctrl+Alt+G`. That said, change the `"key"` entry to any keybinding you wish!

Once those steps are completed, you're ready to use the gander assistant with a keyboard shortcut.
