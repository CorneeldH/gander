The gander package allows [elmer](https://elmer.tidyverse.org) chats to interface directly with your RStudio and Positron sessions. After (optionally) selecting some code, press the keyboard shortcut you've chosen to trigger the assistant (we suggest `Ctrl+Cmd+G`, as in "help") and write your request.

## Installation

You can install gander like so:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/gander")
```

Then, ensure that you have an [`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`](https://console.anthropic.com/) environment variable set, and you're ready to go. If you'd like to use an LLM other than Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet—like OpenAI's ChatGPT or a local ollama model—to power the gander see `?gander_options`.

The gander assistant is interfaced with the via the gander addin. For easiest access, we recommend registering the gander addin to a keyboard shortcut.

**In RStudio**, navigate to `Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts > Search "gander"`—we suggest `Ctrl+Alt+G` (or `Ctrl+Cmd+G` on macOS).

**In Positron**, you'll need to open the command palette, run "Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)", and paste the following into your `keybindings.json`:

```json
    {
        "key": "Ctrl+Cmd+G",
        "command": "workbench.action.executeCode.console",
        "when": "editorTextFocus",
        "args": {
            "langId": "r",
            "code": "gander::gander_addin()",
            "focus": true
        }
    }
```

The analogous keybinding on non-macOS is `Ctrl+Alt+G`. That said, change the `"key"` entry to any keybinding you wish!

Once those steps are completed, you're ready to use the gander assistant with a keyboard shortcut.

## Example

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig.alt: "A screencast demonstrating usage. In an RStudio session, I select some ggplot code, trigger the addin and type 'add axis labels', and then the model adds the needed code in-place."
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonpcouch/gander/refs/heads/main/inst/figs/gander.gif")
```
